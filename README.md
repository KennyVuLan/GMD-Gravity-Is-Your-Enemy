Embark on a journey through the vast unknown in a precision-based spaceflight challenge. Stranded in deep space, players must pilot their ship through treacherous environments shaped by mysterious gravitational anomalies. The primary threats come in the form of drifting meteors and unpredictable terrain, demanding careful maneuvering rather than reckless speed.

Built on the principle of "onion design," the game layers new challenges over a solid foundation of core movement mechanics. Gravity isn’t just a background force—it’s a dynamic opponent. Success relies on mastering thrust, timing, and direction to avoid environmental hazards. Mistakes are meaningful, with collisions resetting progress, encouraging deliberate play.
